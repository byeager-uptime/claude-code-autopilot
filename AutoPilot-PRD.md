# Claude Code AutoPilot - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

**Product**: Claude Code AutoPilot Extension  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Target Release**: Q2 2025  
**Owner**: Product Team  
**Status**: Draft for Review  

AutoPilot is a Claude Code extension that enables autonomous code execution with automatic validation and rollback capabilities. It transforms Claude Code from an interactive assistant into a self-validating development partner that can safely execute changes without constant human oversight.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
1. **Constant Context Switching**: Developers must manually test every Claude Code change, breaking flow state
2. **Time Waste**: 3-5 minutes per change spent on manual validation (test, lint, build)
3. **Forgotten Validation**: Developers skip testing steps, leading to broken commits
4. **Batch Operation Inefficiency**: Can't safely execute multiple changes in sequence
5. **Fear of Automation**: Developers don't trust AI changes without manual verification

### User Impact
- **Senior Developers**: Lose 2-3 hours daily to manual validation of routine changes
- **Junior Developers**: Uncertain when/how to validate changes properly
- **Team Leads**: Broken builds from inadequate testing of AI-generated code
- **DevOps Teams**: Increased CI/CD failures from untested commits

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **Development Velocity**: 60-70% reduction in time-to-completion for routine tasks
- **Context Switching**: 50% fewer manual validation interruptions
- **Code Quality**: 90% reduction in validation failures reaching version control
- **User Adoption**: 70% of Claude Code users enable AutoPilot within 30 days

### Secondary KPIs
- **Error Recovery**: 95% successful automatic rollback rate
- **Test Coverage**: 100% of AutoPilot changes include validation
- **User Satisfaction**: 4.5+ star rating on plugin store
- **Support Load**: <5% increase in support tickets despite automation

  - Conflict resolution for partial rollbacks
```

#### 3. Issue Resolution Verification Engine
```yaml
feature: issue_verification
priority: P0
user_story: "As a developer, I want 100% confidence that the specific issue I reported is actually fixed, not just that tests pass"

verification_process:
  issue_reproduction:
    - Reproduce the original bug/issue before making changes
    - Document the failure case with specific symptoms
    - Create targeted test case for the specific issue
    
  targeted_validation:
    - Test the exact scenario that was failing
    - Verify the specific symptoms are resolved
    - Confirm the fix doesn't introduce related issues
    
  proof_of_fix:
    - Screenshot/video evidence for GUI issues
    - API response validation for backend issues
    - Performance metrics for optimization issues
    - Security scan results for security fixes

acceptance_criteria:
  - Must reproduce the issue before claiming it's fixed
  - Targeted validation specifically tests the reported problem
  - Provides concrete evidence the issue is resolved
  - Distinguishes between "tests pass" and "issue fixed"
  - Fails verification if issue symptoms still exist

technical_requirements:
  - Issue tracking and reproduction framework
  - Evidence collection system (screenshots, logs, metrics)
  - Targeted test case generation
  - Before/after comparison automation
```

#### 4. Requirement Clarification Engine
```yaml
feature: requirement_clarity
priority: P0
user_story: "As a developer, I want Claude to understand exactly what I need before starting work, not implement demo solutions"

clarification_process:
  requirement_analysis:
    - Parse user request for ambiguous terms
    - Identify missing critical information
    - Detect scope creep indicators
    
  confirmation_dialogue:
    - Ask specific clarifying questions
    - Confirm understanding of the core problem
    - Validate scope and expected outcome
    
  implementation_focus:
    - Focus on the actual problem, not workarounds
    - Avoid implementing demo data or placeholder solutions
    - Ensure real functionality, not just "something working"

acceptance_criteria:
  - Asks clarifying questions for ambiguous requests
  - Confirms understanding before starting implementation
  - Distinguishes between demo/placeholder and real solutions
  - Refuses to proceed without clear requirements
  - Validates that the solution addresses the actual need

examples:
  bad_interpretation: 
    user: "Make the login work"
    claude_wrong: "I'll create demo users and hardcode credentials"
    claude_right: "What specifically isn't working with login? Are you getting errors, is auth failing, or is the UI broken?"
    
  good_clarification:
    user: "Fix the API"
    claude_asks: "Which API endpoint is having issues? What error are you seeing? Is it a 500 error, authentication problem, or data formatting issue?"
```

#### 5. Confidence-Based Execution
```yaml
feature: confidence_scoring
priority: P0
user_story: "As a developer, I want Claude to automatically execute safe changes while asking permission for risky ones"

acceptance_criteria:
  - Calculates confidence score (0-100) for each operation
  - Auto-executes changes with confidence >85
  - Prompts for approval on confidence 60-85
  - Requires explicit approval for confidence <60
  - Learns from user feedback to improve scoring

confidence_factors:
  - Operation type (low-risk: formatting, high-risk: logic changes)
  - Code area (low-risk: tests, high-risk: core business logic)
  - Historical success rate for similar operations
  - Validation complexity and coverage
```

#### 4. AutoPilot Command Interface
```yaml
feature: autopilot_commands
priority: P0
user_story: "As a developer, I want to add autopilot to any existing Claude command with a simple flag"

simple_activation:
  any_command: "claude [any existing command] --auto"
  examples:
    - "claude fix the login bug --auto"
    - "claude implement user authentication --auto" 
    - "claude refactor the payment system --auto"

global_modes:
  autopilot_on: "claude --autopilot-on"    # Enable for all subsequent commands
  autopilot_off: "claude --autopilot-off"  # Disable autopilot mode

flags:
  --auto: "Enable autopilot for this command only"
  --auto-safe: "Enable autopilot only for high-confidence operations"
  --verify-fix: "Require proof that the specific issue is actually resolved"
  --no-rollback: "Disable automatic rollback (use with caution)"
```

## User Experience

### Installation Flow
```bash
# Install via npm
npm install -g claude-autopilot

# Initialize in project
cd my-project
claude-autopilot init
# Creates .claude/autopilot-config.yml with detected settings

# Verify installation
claude "hello" --auto
# Should show "AutoPilot enabled" confirmation
```

### Typical Usage Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Bug Fix with Issue Verification
```bash
User: "Fix the null pointer error in utils.js --auto"

AutoPilot Flow:
1. Requirement Clarification: "I see a null pointer error mention. Can you show me the specific error message or describe when this occurs?"
2. User: "When users click submit without entering email, console shows 'Cannot read property email of null'"
3. Issue Reproduction: Reproduces the error, captures screenshot/logs
4. Confidence Score: 85 (clear issue, reproducible)
5. Auto-Execute: Implement null check for email field
6. Multi-Agent Validation:
   - Unit Test Agent: ✅ All unit tests pass
   - GUI Test Agent: ✅ Visual regression passed, interaction test shows proper error handling
   - Integration Agent: ✅ Form submission works correctly
7. Issue Verification: ✅ Original error no longer occurs, proper validation message shown
8. Result: "✅ Null pointer error fixed. Confirmed the specific issue is resolved with before/after evidence."
```

#### Scenario 2: GUI Feature with Comprehensive Testing
```bash
User: "Add a loading spinner to the login button --auto"

AutoPilot Flow:
1. Clarification: "Should the spinner appear immediately on click, or after a delay? What should happen to the button text?"
2. User: "Immediately on click, button should be disabled and show spinner instead of text"
3. Confidence Score: 88 (clear requirements, UI change)
4. Auto-Execute: Implement loading state with spinner
5. Multi-Agent Validation:
   - GUI Test Agent: ✅ Visual regression baseline updated, interaction tests confirm button states
   - Unit Test Agent: ✅ Component state tests pass
   - Accessibility Agent: ✅ Screen reader announcements work, focus management correct
6. Issue Verification: ✅ Loading behavior works as specified
7. Result: "✅ Loading spinner implemented with full accessibility support and visual testing."
```

#### Scenario 3: Unclear Request Requiring Clarification
```bash
User: "Make the API work --auto"

AutoPilot Flow:
1. Requirement Analysis: Detected ambiguous request
2. Clarification Questions: 
   - "Which specific API endpoint is having issues?"
   - "What error are you seeing? (400, 500, timeout, etc.)"
   - "Is this about authentication, data formatting, or server errors?"
3. User: "The POST /users endpoint returns 500 when I try to create a user"
4. Issue Reproduction: Attempts to reproduce 500 error, captures request/response
5. Confidence Score: 82 (specific issue identified)
6. Auto-Execute: Fix server error in user creation
7. Multi-Agent Validation:
   - Integration Test Agent: ✅ API endpoint now returns 201 with proper user data
   - Security Test Agent: ✅ Input validation working correctly
8. Issue Verification: ✅ Original 500 error no longer occurs, user creation successful
9. Result: "✅ API fixed. POST /users now successfully creates users instead of returning 500 error."
```

#### Scenario 4: Validation Failure with Rollback
```bash
User: "Optimize the database query performance --auto"

AutoPilot Flow:
1. Clarification: "Which query needs optimization? Are you seeing slow response times or high CPU usage?"
2. User: "User search query takes 3+ seconds, needs to be under 500ms"
3. Issue Reproduction: Measures current query performance (3.2s average)
4. Confidence Score: 72 (performance optimization, medium risk)
5. Execute: Implements query optimization with indexing
6. Multi-Agent Validation:
   - Performance Test Agent: ❌ Query now takes 2.8s (still too slow)
   - Unit Test Agent: ✅ All tests pass
7. Issue Verification: ❌ Performance target not met
8. Auto-Rollback: Reverts changes
9. Result: "❌ Optimization didn't meet performance target (2.8s vs 500ms goal). Changes rolled back. Suggests: Consider different indexing strategy or query redesign."
```

### Error Handling

#### Common Failure Scenarios
1. **Validation Timeout**: Tests run longer than 30s → Auto-abort with option to extend
2. **Partial Rollback Failure**: Some files can't be reverted → Manual intervention required
3. **Configuration Missing**: No test command detected → Prompt user to configure
4. **Permission Issues**: Can't write to files → Clear error message with resolution steps

#### Error Recovery
```yaml
error_recovery:
  validation_timeout:
    action: "Abort operation, preserve changes, notify user"
    user_options: ["Extend timeout", "Continue without validation", "Rollback changes"]
    
  rollback_failure:
    action: "Stop rollback, preserve partial state, request manual intervention"
    user_options: ["Manual rollback instructions", "Continue with partial rollback", "Emergency backup restore"]
    
  configuration_error:
    action: "Disable autopilot, continue with manual mode"
    user_options: ["Configure autopilot", "Use manual mode", "Skip this operation"]
```

## Security & Risk Considerations

### Security Measures
1. **Sandboxed Execution**: All validation runs in isolated environment
2. **File Permissions**: Respects existing file system permissions
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete log of all autopilot operations
4. **User Consent**: Clear prompts for risky operations
5. **Rollback Protection**: Multiple rollback strategies (git, snapshots, backups)

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Confidence Calibration**: Conservative initial thresholds, user-adjustable
2. **Validation Requirements**: No execution without successful validation setup
3. **Emergency Stop**: Ctrl+C immediately halts autopilot operations
4. **Manual Override**: Users can always disable autopilot mid-operation
5. **Team Controls**: Team leads can set organization-wide policies

### Privacy Considerations
1. **Local Operation**: All processing happens locally, no cloud dependencies
2. **Opt-in Telemetry**: Anonymous usage statistics only with explicit consent
3. **No Code Transmission**: User code never leaves local environment
4. **Secure Storage**: Configuration encrypted at rest
