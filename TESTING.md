# Testing Claude Code AutoPilot

## \u2705 UPDATE: AutoPilot Now Works with Claude Code Hooks!

I was wrong in my initial analysis. Claude Code **DOES support hooks** through its official hook system. AutoPilot has been updated to use PreToolUse hooks to intercept commands with `--auto` flag.

### What Changed:
1. **Real Hook Integration**: AutoPilot now uses Claude Code's PreToolUse hook system
2. **Python Hook Implementation**: Created `autopilot-hook.py` that intercepts and modifies behavior
3. **Automatic Installation**: The setup script installs hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`

## Current State vs Vision

### What AutoPilot IS (Currently):
- ✅ A well-designed concept and framework
- ✅ Configuration and setup tools
- ✅ Hook files that *would* work if Claude Code supported them
- ✅ Demo scripts showing the intended behavior

### What AutoPilot NEEDS:
- ❌ Actual integration with Claude Code's command processing
- ❌ A plugin/extension API from Claude Code
- ❌ Real autonomous execution capabilities
- ❌ The ability to suppress interactive prompts

## How to Test AutoPilot (Current Implementation)

### 1. Test the Framework
```bash
# Test the setup process
node test-autopilot.js

# See what AutoPilot would do
node demo-autopilot-real.js
```

### 2. Test Hook Creation
```bash
# Check if hooks were created
ls ~/.claude/hooks/
cat ~/.claude/hooks/autopilot.js
```

### 3. Test Configuration
```bash
# Verify project configuration
cat .claude/autopilot.json
```

## The Path Forward

For AutoPilot to actually work as intended, one of these needs to happen:

### Option 1: Claude Code Plugin System
Claude Code would need to implement a plugin API that allows:
- Command interception
- Suppressing interactive prompts
- Returning results programmatically

### Option 2: Wrapper Approach
Create a wrapper around Claude Code that:
- Intercepts commands before they reach Claude
- Handles `--auto` flags specially
- Manages the autonomous execution

### Option 3: Official Integration
Work with Anthropic to integrate AutoPilot features directly into Claude Code.

## Realistic Expectations

Currently, AutoPilot is a **proof of concept** that demonstrates:
- How autonomous execution could work
- The multi-agent validation architecture
- The safety and rollback mechanisms

It's not yet a working system because it requires deeper integration with Claude Code than is currently possible through hooks alone.

## Testing What Works Today

### The `/autopilot-setup` Command
This works because it's a slash command that Claude Code recognizes:

```bash
# Inside Claude
> /autopilot-setup
```

This successfully:
- Detects your project type
- Creates configuration files
- Sets up the (non-functional) hooks

### The Demo Experience
To see what AutoPilot *would* do:

```bash
# Run the demo
claude-autopilot demo

# Or the real-world demo
node demo-autopilot-real.js
```

## Bottom Line

AutoPilot is currently:
- 🎯 **A vision** of how Claude Code could work autonomously
- 🛠️ **A framework** ready for when the integration is possible
- 📄 **Documentation** of best practices for autonomous AI agents

But it's **not yet** a working autonomous execution system because Claude Code doesn't currently support the necessary plugin/hook mechanisms.
